Man:My daughter fell and hit her head. She’s been crying non-stop, and I’m worried!

Bryan:Alright, sir, stay calm. We’ll take a look
Bryan:Max, grab the kit. Davide, check her vitals

->Davide:Hey there, sweetheart. It’s okay, we’re here to help. Can you tell me your name?
     Child:Lily...
     Man:Thank you, thank you so much!
->Davide:Sir, step back, please 
     Davide:What’s your name? Where does it hurt? We need to assess her condition
     Child:Lily...
     Man:O-of course, just help her, please
->Davide:What happened here? This shouldn’t have escalated like this
     Davide:What’s your name, kiddo?
     Child:L-Lily...
     Man:I-I didn’t mean for this to happen. I’m sorry!
     <<jump Scolding>>
Davide:Alright, Lily. I’m Davide. Let me just take a quick look, okay?
Bryan:She’s in good hands, sir. Let’s just give them a moment
Davide:She’s got a bump, but nothing serious
Davide:Just keep an eye on her, and if she gets dizzy or feels sick later, take her to the hospital
Man:Thank you so much. Really, thank you

Bryan:Davide, can I have a word?
->Davide:Sure, is everything ok?
->Davide:ok
->Davide:"silently goes to Bryan"

Bryan:Look, I understand that situations like this can be frustrating
Bryan:But you’re addressing a child and a panicked parent
Bryan:They’re already scared; we can’t add to that

Davide:You’re right, Bryan
Davide:I didn’t mean to sound harsh

Bryan:I know you didn’t, but perception matters
Bryan:Kids pick up on tone, and we need to build trust, not fear
Bryan:Next time, take a breath before speaking. Keep it calm, keep it steady

Davide:Got it. I’ll do better

Bryan:Good. Let’s get back to the ambulance
