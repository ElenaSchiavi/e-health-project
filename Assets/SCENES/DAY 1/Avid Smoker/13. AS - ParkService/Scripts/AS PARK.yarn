Bryan:Davide, can I have a word?
->Davide:Sure, is everything ok?
->Davide:ok
->Davide:"silently goes to Bryan"

Bryan:Look, I understand that situations like this can be frustrating
Bryan:But you’re addressing a child and a panicked parent
Bryan:They’re already scared; we can’t add to that

Davide:You’re right, Bryan
Davide:I didn’t mean to sound harsh.

Bryan:I know you didn’t, but perception matters
Bryan:Kids pick up on tone, and we need to build trust, not fear
Bryan:Next time, take a breath before speaking. Keep it calm, keep it steady

Davide:Got it. I’ll do better

Bryan:Good. Let’s get back to the ambulance
